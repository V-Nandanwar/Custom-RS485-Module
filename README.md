# Custom RS485 Communication Module (Hardware Project)

This repository documents the design process for a custom 2-layer RS485 communication module created to ensure robust, long-distance data transfer for robotics applications in noisy environments.

*(Note: This is a hardware-focused project. Detailed schematics, Gerbers, and a Bill of Materials will be uploaded shortly.)*

## Project Overview & Motivation
The goal of this project was to develop a deep, fundamental understanding of a commercial RS485 module by replicating its functionality from scratch. This involved a complete reverse-engineering and custom PCB production cycle.

## Key Technical Contributions
*   **Reverse-Engineering:** Analyzed and deconstructed a commercial RS48S module to create a complete component-level schematic and understand its operational principles.
*   **PCB Design & Fabrication:** Designed and laid out a custom 2-layer PCB in Altium, focusing on best practices for high signal integrity and noise immunity (e.g., differential pair routing, controlled impedance).
*   **Component Selection:** Sourced and selected all components, including the RS485 transceiver IC and passive elements, to match the performance of the original module.
